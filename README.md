# BMI-CALCULATOR
BMI assesses weight relative to height by dividing weight in kg by height in meters squared. It categorizes individuals into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese ranges, serving as a simple tool in healthcare discussions on weight management and health.


A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to assess an individual's body weight relative to their height. It's a simple numerical measure derived from a person's weight and height. BMI is commonly used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese categories. The formula for calculating BMI is:

\[ BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2} \]

Where weight is typically measured in kilograms and height is measured in meters.

BMI is a useful tool for quickly assessing whether an individual is within a healthy weight range for their height. However, it's important to note that BMI is not a direct measure of body fatness or overall health. Other factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat can influence an individual's health status, so BMI should be interpreted alongside other measures and clinical assessments.

Despite its limitations, BMI remains a widely used tool in healthcare settings for its simplicity and practicality in providing a general indication of weight status. It's often used by healthcare professionals as a starting point for discussions about weight management and overall health.
